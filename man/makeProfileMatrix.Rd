\usage{
makeProfileMatrix(
  profiles,
  type = c("ramclust", "graphviz"),
  addIndex = ifelse(type[[1]] == "ramclust", TRUE, FALSE),
  reindexProfiles = 0
)
}
\arguments{
\item{profiles}{A profiles object from enviMass}

\item{type}{\code{ramclust} or \code{graphviz}, in the latter case the retention time is inserted as a first row (not only in the column names).}

\item{addIndex}{If \code{TRUE}, add a sample index column in front of the table, as required by RAMClust.}
}
\value{
A matrix m x n, where the rows (sic) are the samples and the columns are the profiles (features) without "profile 0".
The columns are named profileID_RT. This is a requirement for ramclustR (which usually uses mz_RT, but actually doesn't use
mz for calculation and therefore the content is arbitrary. It's easier to use the profile ID for precise lookup.)
